The final executable was compiled on this machine:
gl06 

How to invoke my program: 
Execute the binary ./dungeon [dungeon-map]

Options for how to slow down the FFS can be found in src/constants.hpp.  Other files and configurations may be edited there as well.

Objectives:

1__: The cavern is created from a bitmap file when the game loads, with fractal terrain applied to the walls.
2__: The dungeon janitor and enemies are rendered correctly.
3__: Collisions between the character, enemies, and the cavern walls are handled appropriately.
4__: Texture mapping for dungeon characters and enemies is supported.
5__: Sound effects are triggered by player actions in the game.
6__: Light cast by the player and by torches dissipates in fog.
7__: Shadows are cast by torches and the player’s light source.
8__: Anti-aliasing is used to reduce shadow noise. Shadows cast have smooth edges.
9__: Enemy AI is implemented. The creatures that the player must “clean up” respond appropriately when they are within line of sight of the janitor or are hit by the player.
10__: Animations of the game characters function properly.
